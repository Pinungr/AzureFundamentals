1. Private Cloud.
What it is?
    A private cloud is a computing environment that offers the same features and benefits of a public cloud, 
    but is dedicated to a single organization. It provides greater control over the infrastructure, 
    improved security, and compliance capabilities.


How it is working?
    A private cloud operates by utilizing virtualization technology to pool resources from physical 
    servers and create a flexible, scalable computing environment. The infrastructure is managed and 
    maintained by the organization's IT department or a third-party service provider. Users access resources 
    through a secure network, often using a web-based interface or API. The private cloud can be hosted 
    on-premises or in a data center, providing dedicated resources and enhanced security measures tailored to 
    the organization's needs.

Where it is used?
    Private clouds are commonly used by organizations that require enhanced security, compliance, 
    and control over their data and infrastructure. They are ideal for industries with strict regulatory requirements, 
    such as finance, healthcare, and government. Private clouds are also used by large enterprises that need to manage 
    sensitive information, ensure data privacy, and maintain high levels of performance and availability. Additionally, 
    private clouds are suitable for organizations that have specific customization needs or require dedicated 
    resources to support their business operations.
